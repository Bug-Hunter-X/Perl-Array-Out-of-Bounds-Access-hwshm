This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an element in an array beyond its defined bounds. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version.  The error results in undefined behavior, potentially crashing the program or producing incorrect results. The solution emphasizes proper bounds checking before accessing array elements.
